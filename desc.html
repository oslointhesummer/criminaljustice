				Chinese Americans constitute one group of overseas Chinese and also a subgroup of East Asian Americans, which is a further subgroup of Asian Americans. Many Chinese Americans are immigrants along with their descendants from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan,[5] as well as from other regions that include large populations of the Chinese diaspora, especially Southeast Asia and some Western countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and France.

The Chinese American community is the largest overseas Chinese community outside Asia. It is also the third largest community in the Chinese diaspora, behind the Chinese communities in Thailand and Malaysia.

The implementation of Privatization and liberalization had changed the entire outflow of migrants. The emergence of Information Technology industry in Indian cities as Bangalore and Hyderabad had led to the large number of migrations to the USA

			<h1 class="card-title">Filipino American</h1>
			<p>
				Filipinos in North America were first documented in the 16th century,[20] and other small settlements beginning in the 18th century.[21] Mass migration did not begin until after the end of the Spanish-American War at the end of the 19th Century, when the Philippines was ceded from Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. Filipino sailors were the first Asians in North America in 1587.

			<h1 class="card-title">Vietnamese American</h1>
			<p>
				The Vietnamese community in the United States was minimal until the South Vietnamese immigration to the country following the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. Early immigrants were refugee boat people, loyal to South Vietnam in the conflict who fled political persecution or sought economic opportunities. More than half of Vietnamese Americans reside in the two most populous states of California and Texas, primarily their large urban areas.

			<h1 class="card-title">Korean American</h1>
			<p>
				 There are 1.8 million people of Korean descent residing in the United States, making it the country with the second largest Korean population living outside Korea (after the People's Republic of China). The U.S. is home to the largest Korean diaspora community in the world. 
        Korean Americans can speak a combination of English and Korean depending on where they were born and when they immigrated to the United States. New immigrants often use a mixture of Korean and English (Konglish)

			<h1 class="card-title">Japanese American</h1>
			<p>
				 Japanese American have declined in number to constitute the sixth largest Asian American group at around 773,000, including those of partial ancestry.

These early Issei immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas

			<h1 class="card-title">Hmong American</h1>

Another four million live in the Southeast Asian countries of Thailand, Burma, Laos and Vietnam, where they immigrated during the 19th century following centuries of persecution in China. There, they existed mostly as farmers living in rural areas.

			<h1 class="card-title">Pakistani American</h1>
			<p>
			Although Pakistani Americans retain a strong ethnic identity, they are known to assimilate into American culture while at the same time keeping the culture of their ancestors. Pakistani Americans are known to assimilate more easily than many other immigrant groups because they have fewer language barriers (English is the official language of Pakistan and widely spoken), more educational credentials (immigrants are disproportionately well educated among Pakistanis), and come from a similarly diverse, relatively tolerant, and multi-ethnic society.
